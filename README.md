**What is Requirement Analysis**
Requirement analysis is basically the process of figuring out what exactly needs to be built before you start developing software. It is almost like, “What do you want your house to look like?” before you even pick up a hammer. It’s about understanding the needs, goals, and expectations of the people who will use the software, and then putting all that into a clear plan. In software terms, that means sitting down with clients, users, or teams to find out what they want the software to do, why they want it, and how they expect it to behave. It’s one of the first and most important steps in the software development process.

*Types of Requirements*
a. Functional Requirements: Describe what the system should do. (e.g User login, data entry, generating reports.)
b. Non-Functional Requirements: Define how the system should perform. (e.g Performance, security, usability, reliability.)
c. Business Requirements: High-level goals of the organization or stakeholders. (e.g “Improve user retention by 20%.”)
d. User Requirements: End-user goals or tasks the system must support.
e. System Requirements: The detailed specifications derived from business and user requirements, often more technical.

*Activities in Requirement Analysis*
1. Requirement Elicitation - Gathering requirements through:
    * Interviews, surveys, focus groups
    * Observation, document analysis
    * Prototyping or brainstorming
2. Requirement Documentation - Writing down requirements clearly in formats like:
    * Software Requirements Specification (SRS)
    * User stories or use cases
    * Process models or diagrams
3. Requirement Validation - Ensuring requirements are:
    * Accurate, complete, feasible, and unambiguous
    * Reviewed and approved by stakeholders
4. Requirement Analysis and Prioritization
    * Analyzing dependencies, conflicts, and priorities
    * Deciding what to build first and why

*Importance of Requirement Analysis in the SDLC*
1. Foundation for Design and Development: Requirement analysis acts as the blueprint for the entire development process. Without it, developers may build a product that doesn't solve the right problem.
2. Reduces Project Risk: Clear requirements prevent miscommunication, scope creep, and rework, which are often the cause of software failure or budget overruns.
3. Improves Stakeholder Satisfaction: By involving stakeholders early, requirement analysis ensures the final product aligns with actual business needs.
4. Facilitates Better Planning and Estimation: Well-defined requirements help project managers estimate time, cost, and resources more accurately.
5. Supports Testing and Validation: Requirements serve as the basis for creating test cases to verify that the software meets user expectations.
